[Scheneier on Security: The Security Mindset](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html)

## Thinking like an attacker
- What is the weakest link?
	- Old libraries
	- Memory-unsafe code
	- Complex algorithm implementation
	- Humans in the loop
- What assumptions did the defenders make?

## Thinking like a defender
- Who are you defending against?
	- What are their capabilities?
- What assets are you defending?
- What security properties do you want to enforce?
	- Authenticity
	- Integrity
	- Confidentiality
	- Availability
- What attacks do we want to prevent?
- Cost-benefit analysis: what attacks should we ignore?

### Assessing risk
- Type of cost
	- Direct: assets
	- Indirect: reputation
- Magnitude of cost
- Probability of attack
- Probability of successful attack

### Countermeasures
- Technical
- Non-technical
	- Audits
	- Policy
	- Incentives
