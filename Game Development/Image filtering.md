- Raster images
	- Defined in terms of pixels
- Vector images
	- Defined in terms of points and lines on a cartesian plane

## Aliasing
- Smooth continuous curves -> rasterised using pixels -> [jagged edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaggies)
- Anti-aliasing: pixels near the edges are filtered to reduce the appearance of jaggedness

## Nearest neighbour
