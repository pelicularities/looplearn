## Process vs Program
- A **program** is just bits on disk
- A **process** is a *running* program, or a program *in execution*

## Why do we need the abstraction of a process?

## Process API
- Create
- Destroy
- Wait
- Miscellaneous Control
	- Suspend
	- Resume
	- etc.
- Status

## Process States
- **Running:** executing instructions on a processor
- **Ready:** ready to run but not actually running for some reason
- **Blocked:** not ready to run until some condition is met
