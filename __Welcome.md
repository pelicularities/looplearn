This is where I [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), with a little bit of [digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) thrown in. 

What this place is **not**:
- Curated
- Authoritative
- Comprehensive

What this place **is**:
- Messy
- Dynamic
- Always a work in progress

My process:
- When I find something I want to learn, I create a new page
- As I learn about it, I make notes
- At various points in my learning, I restructure the notes I have and add links, images, tags, etc.
- Periodically, I publish the state of this Obsidian vault

This results in a vault with:
- Many blank pages: I want to learn about something, but haven't gotten round to it yet
	- Alternatively: I know about something and want to consolidate my knowledge into a cheat sheet, but haven't gotten round to it yet
- Unstructured notes: I'm making notes as I learn, and my mental model will constantly shift
- Unlinked notes: Pages that should be linked, whether internally or externally, may not be for a while, because links take time to form and involve administrative overhead
- Uncontextualised links: Sometimes I find something interesting on the Internet and want a place to keep it for future reference
	- They may be uncontextualised because I haven't formed thoughts or opinions about them yet
- Mostly text: Things that may be better expressed as images or audio or video may not be, simply because I place a premium on being able to take and publish my notes quickly, and text is faster
